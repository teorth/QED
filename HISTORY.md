  fixed (thanks to dP dt and Andre Maute for reporting the error). Also
  patched bugs in universal specification and universal introduction (thanks
  to dP dt for reporting the first error).

* **Version 1.15** (released Aug 11, 2018). Alpha version of Section 22,
  introducing the existential introduction law (the first law in which one
  can have multiple deductions from a single choice of inputs for reasons
  other than permutation of the inputs). Several "invisible" changes to data
  structures. Some helper exercises in earlier sections added.

* **Version 1.14.3** (released Aug 9, 2018). Sections and exercises layout
  revamped (thanks to dP dt for the suggestion). Exercises now come with the
  section title as well.

  discovering this issue).</I>

* **Version 1.14** (released Aug 9, 2018). Alpha versions of Sections 20, 21
  added, introducing a "pull" law and also an existence law to rule out empty
  domains of discourse. Section 13 rearranged and expanded, with a new helper
  exercise (13.2(b)) that shortens some subsequent proofs. Enforced an
  important requirement in the law of universal specification, namely that
  the term one specifies to cannot involve bound variables.

* **Version 1.13.1** (released Aug 8, 2018). Text of Exercise 19.1 fixed.
  Double push exercise added in Exercise 15.2. Deductions resulting in
  ill-formed statements will now be displayed but grayed out, rather than
  hidden completely (thanks to Keith Winstein for this suggestion). Layout of
  main windows rearranged.

* **Version 1.13** (released Aug 7, 2018). Alpha version of Section 19
  added, introducing the existential quantifier and the ability to
  instantiate an existential statement using a "setting" environment. Section
  10 reorganised with a new exercise intended to shorten the proofs of
  subsequent exercises proving IFF statements (in particular, several
  exercises in Section 10 onwards (particularly those whose conclusion
  involves IFF) now have shorter proofs). New hotkeys: 'n' for first
  available unsolved exercise, 'N' for last available unsolved exercise. New
  record for 9.5(a). Bug with new free and bound variables in Exercise

  added, introducing the ability to specialise a universal statement to a
  term. Primitive terms also introduced.

  added, introducing the ability to introduce a universal quantifier over a
  bound variables (which is now equipped with a button to generate such
  variables). Some bugs with finding available deductions fixed. Alternate
  push law functionality added in which one can push to an environment not
  yet created by dragging to a formula rather than to the environment. (As a
  consequence, Exercises 7.1 and 7.2 now have shorter proofs.) Bad hyperlink
  (to idempotence) fixed.

* **Version 1.10.1** (released Aug 6, 2018). An exploit involving enabling a
  deduction, undoing the previous deduction, then selecting a (now
  unjustified) deduction has been patched (thanks to Keith Winstein for
  finding the exploit). Some rewording for the Exercise 1.1 text (following
  suggestions by arch1).

* **Version 1.10** (released Aug 5, 2018). Alpha version of Section 16
  added, introducing the ability to introduce free variables from a new Term
  window (which is also equipped with a button to generate new variables).
  Code separated into logic.js, which contains the GUI-independent components
  of the code, and gui.js, which contains the GUI-dependent components (for
  future modularity).

* **Version 1.9** (released Aug 4, 2018). Environments now clickable.
  Hotkeys "u" for immediate undo and "r" for restart. Alpha version of
  Sections 14, 15 added, introducing free variable environments and atomic
  sentences involving predicates and free variables, and a new PUSH law. Some
  bad hyperlinks (reported by Mauricio de Oliveira) repaired. Fixed a bug
  (reported by Matthew Steffen) regarding whether cloned laws qualified for
  non-circular proofs. Some laws taking a target environment as an input now
  have that environment removed in view of the clone functionality.

* **Version 1.8.1** (released Aug 4, 2018). Error in PUSH law (and other
  laws involving a non-root environment) fixed. (Thanks to Andre Maute for
  reporting the bug.)

* **Version 1.8** (released Aug 3, 2018). Restart exercise button added.
  Further "under the hood" changes. Laws with root environment default now
  come with a "clone" with one additional hypothesis that allows one to
  select the root environment.

* **Version 1.7.1** (released Aug 2, 2018). Can now use ctrl-click to select
  items, in particular allowing for more than two items to be selected. The
  numbers 1-9 are now keyboard shortcuts for the first 9 deductions in the
  Available deductions window.

* **Version 1.7** (released Aug 2, 2018). Dragging X to Y now also checks
  for laws available from dragging Y to X. Exercise 1.1 changed (so legacy
  players may artificially have beaten the shortest length now for this
  exercise). Various "under the hood" code changes in preparation for
  extension to first order logic. Various sections of game now collapsed by
  default.

* **Version 1.6.2** (released Aug 1, 2018). New records for Exercises
  9.5(b), 10.1(b), 13.2(a), 13.3(a), 13.3(d). Duplicate unlocking of laws
  prevented. Table of boolean duality added to Exercise 12.5(d). Typo
  corrections.

  FALSE; new exercises (and a new section) added.

* **Version 1.5.3** (released July 31, 2018). Rules appearing in text at or
  after an exercise can still be used, but have an asterisk attached to them
  and no longer trigger records.

* **Version 1.5.2** (released July 30, 2018). New record for Exercise 10.4.

* **Version 1.5.1** (released July 30, 2018). New record for Exercise
  9.3(d). Improved backwards capability (game states from prior versions
  should now be able to re-unlock exercises and laws).

* **Version 1.5** (released July 30, 2018). Completing all exercises allows
  one to reveal the shortest known proofs. Some inaccuracies in the shortest
  known proofs corrected. A bug regarding the interaction between the UNDO
  button and the number of lines of the proof has been fixed.

* **Version 1.4** (released July 30, 2018). Exercises organised by section.
  Solved exercises are now green or blue depending on whether the shortest
  length was achieved. HTML links now open in a new tab so as not to disrupt
  game state. Immediate UNDO button added.

* **Version 1.3.2** (released July 30, 2018). New records for Exercises
  2.2(b), 12.5(c). Clarifications and typo fixes to text.

* **Version 1.3.1** (released July 30, 2018). Implemented the styling
  suggestions of redblobgames.

* **Version 1.3** (released July 30, 2018). Newer record for Exercise
  12.6(a). Bad hyperlink (pointed out by Andrew Lei) fixed. Successful proofs
  can now be expanded and collapsed in the notifications window.

* **Version 1.2.2** (released July 29, 2018). New record for Exercise
  12.6(a). A typo causing exercises to not load beyond 12.2(b) has been
  repaired. (Thanks to William Chargin for pointing out the issue and
  providing a fix.)

* **Version 1.2.1** (released July 29, 2018). New records for Exercises
  7.2, 9.2(a), 12.2(b), 12.2(c), 12.4(b), 12.6(c). Some incorrect proof
  lengths fixed.

* **Version 1.2** (released July 29, 2018). Achievements and notifications
  windows now side-by side. Achievements now list from newest to oldest
  rather than vice versa. "No available deductions" response added. Clicking
  on deductions twice no longer creates duplicates (thanks to ahartel for
  this suggestion). Some clarifications added to text. Best known proof
  lengths added. Exercises 5.1 and 12.1(c) corrected; other minor
  corrections. Some new exercises added.

* **Version 1.1** (released July 29, 2018). Tests if local storage is
  supported. Exercise 7.2 repaired (and all subsequent exercises now
  accessible). All exercise buttons now visible (not just unlocked ones).
  Spelling corrections.
